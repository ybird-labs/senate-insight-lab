# Senate Insight Lab

A comprehensive analysis tool for investigating Congressional members' investments and identifying potential insider trading patterns based on legislative activities and committee assignments.

## üéØ Purpose

This project analyzes the relationship between Congressional members' stock trades and their legislative work to identify potential insider trading opportunities. It combines:

- Congressional voting records and committee assignments
- Financial disclosure data and stock transactions  
- Stock market performance data
- Advanced correlation analysis algorithms

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ybird-labs/senate-insight-lab.git
cd senate-insight-lab

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp config/example.env .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
# You'll need:
# - Congress API key (from congress.gov)
# - Alpha Vantage API key (for stock data)
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize database
senate-insight init-db

# Collect Congressional member data
senate-insight collect-members --chamber both

# Analyze a specific member
senate-insight analyze-member S001234

# Generate analysis report
senate-insight report --format json
```

## üìä Analysis Features

### Detection Algorithms

1. **Timing Correlation Analysis**
   - Identifies trades made shortly before relevant legislative actions
   - Configurable time windows (default: 30 days)
   - Weights based on proximity to legislative events

2. **Committee Correlation Analysis**
   - Maps committee assignments to relevant industries
   - Scores trades based on member's oversight responsibilities
   - Identifies potential conflicts of interest

3. **Price Movement Analysis**
   - Analyzes stock performance following trades
   - Calculates abnormal returns
   - Identifies suspiciously profitable trades

4. **Volume Anomaly Detection**
   - Detects unusual trading volume around transaction dates
   - Uses statistical analysis to identify outliers
   - Correlates with potential information leaks

### Confidence Scoring

Each potential insider trading alert receives a confidence score (0-1) based on:
- **Timing** (30%): How close the trade was to relevant legislative action
- **Committee Correlation** (25%): Relevance of member's committees to the stock
- **Price Movement** (35%): Favorable price movement after the trade
- **Volume Anomaly** (10%): Unusual trading volume patterns

## üîß Configuration

Key configuration options in `.env`:

```bash
# Analysis thresholds
TIMING_WINDOW_DAYS=30              # Days to check before/after trades
SIGNIFICANT_PRICE_CHANGE=0.05      # 5% price movement threshold
MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.3       # Minimum alert confidence

# Data collection
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=5          # API rate limiting
REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS=1.0         # Delay between requests
```

## üìö Examples

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from senate_insight.orchestrator import SenateInsightOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = SenateInsightOrchestrator()

# Run analysis
results = await orchestrator.run_full_pipeline(chamber="senate")

# Generate report
report = orchestrator.generate_summary_report(results['alerts'])
print(report)
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Analyze all members with high confidence threshold
senate-insight analyze-all --min-confidence 0.7

# Collect disclosures for specific member
senate-insight collect-disclosures "Nancy Pelosi" --year 2023

# Generate CSV report
senate-insight report --format csv > insider_trading_report.csv
```
