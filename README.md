# Senate Insight Lab

A comprehensive analysis tool for investigating Congressional members' investments and identifying potential insider trading patterns based on legislative activities and committee assignments.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project analyzes the relationship between Congressional members' stock trades and their legislative work to identify potential insider trading opportunities. It combines:

- Congressional voting records and committee assignments
- Financial disclosure data and stock transactions  
- Stock market performance data
- Advanced correlation analysis algorithms

## ✨ What's Implemented

This repository contains a **fully functional** insider trading detection system with the following components:

### Core Implementation

1. **Data Models** (`senate_insight/models/`)
   - `CongressMember`: Complete member profiles with committee assignments
   - `StockTransaction`: Financial disclosure transaction records
   - `InsiderTradingAlert`: Alert system with confidence scoring
   - `StockPrice`: Stock market data with volume tracking
   - `LegislativeAction`: Legislative activity tracking
   - `CommitteeAssignment`: Committee membership data

2. **Detection Engine** (`senate_insight/analyzers/insider_trading_detector.py`)
   - **Timing Correlation**: Detects trades 0-30 days before legislative actions
   - **Committee Correlation**: Maps committee assignments to stock industries
   - **Price Movement Analysis**: Tracks stock performance up to 30 days post-transaction
   - **Volume Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis of unusual trading patterns
   - **Weighted Confidence Scoring**: Combines all factors into 0-1 confidence score

3. **Data Collectors** (`senate_insight/data_collectors/`)
   - `CongressAPICollector`: Fetches member data, votes, and committee info
   - `FinancialDataCollector`: Collects disclosure data and parses transactions
   - `StockPriceCollector`: Retrieves stock prices and volume from Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage
   - PDF/HTML parsing capabilities for disclosure documents

4. **Orchestration System** (`senate_insight/orchestrator.py`)
   - Coordinates data collection across multiple sources
   - Batch processing for multiple members
   - Summary report generation
   - Alert filtering and prioritization

5. **CLI Interface** (`senate_insight/cli.py`)
   - Initialize database
   - Collect member data
   - Run analysis on specific members or all members
   - Generate reports in multiple formats

### Working Examples

Three complete example scripts demonstrating real functionality:

1. **`examples/basic_usage.py`**: Simple workflow demonstration
2. **`examples/analysis_example.py`**: Single-member detailed analysis
3. **`examples/comprehensive_example.py`**: Multi-member batch analysis

**Sample Output**:
```
🔍 Analyzing Senator Tech...
   ℹ️ Alert (Confidence: 0.48)
      Potential insider trading detected: Senator Tech bought GOOGL on 2023-09-15
      with suspicion score 0.48 (10 days before AI legislation vote)
```

## 🔄 How It Works

The system follows this analysis pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Fetch Congressional member information (chamber, state, party, committees)
   - Collect financial disclosure reports and extract stock transactions
   - Retrieve stock price and volume data for relevant tickers
   - Gather legislative actions (votes, bill sponsorships, committee hearings)

2. **Correlation Analysis**
   - **Timing**: Compare transaction dates to legislative action dates
   - **Committee**: Map member's committee assignments to stock industries
   - **Price**: Analyze stock performance after transactions
   - **Volume**: Detect unusual trading patterns

3. **Scoring & Alerting**
   - Calculate individual scores for each detection method
   - Combine scores using weighted formula
   - Generate alerts above confidence threshold
   - Prioritize by confidence level

4. **Reporting**
   - Filter alerts by confidence level
   - Generate summary statistics
   - Export results in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, text)

**Example Flow:**
```
Senator on Technology Committee → Buys GOOGL stock → 10 days later votes on AI bill
                                        ↓
                    Timing Score: 0.8 (10 days before vote)
                    Committee Score: 0.9 (Technology/Tech stock match)
                    Price Score: 0.6 (Stock up 8% post-transaction)
                    Volume Score: 0.3 (Normal volume)
                                        ↓
                    Confidence: 0.73 → 🚨 HIGH CONFIDENCE ALERT
```

## 📊 Analysis Features

### Detection Algorithms (Implemented)

The system includes four fully implemented detection algorithms:

#### 1. **Timing Correlation Analysis**
```python
# Implementation: senate_insight/analyzers/insider_trading_detector.py
def _calculate_timing_correlation(self, transaction, legislative_actions):
    """Analyzes trades made 0-30 days before relevant legislative actions"""
```
- Identifies trades made shortly before relevant legislative actions
- Configurable time windows (default: 30 days)
- Higher scores for trades made 0-14 days before legislative events
- Considers relevance of legislation to the traded stock

#### 2. **Committee Correlation Analysis**
```python
# Implementation: senate_insight/analyzers/insider_trading_detector.py
def _calculate_committee_correlation(self, transaction, committee_assignments):
    """Maps committee assignments to relevant industries"""
```
- Evaluates whether trades align with member's oversight responsibilities
- Industry mapping includes: Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Energy, Defense
- Example: Technology committee member trading GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT scores high
- Scores trades based on member's committee oversight relevance

#### 3. **Price Movement Analysis**
```python
# Implementation: senate_insight/analyzers/insider_trading_detector.py
def _calculate_price_movement(self, transaction, stock_prices):
    """Analyzes stock performance up to 30 days after transaction"""
```
- Analyzes stock performance following trades
- Examines price changes up to 30 days after transaction
- Higher scores for significant favorable movements (>5% by default)
- Considers both buy and sell transactions

#### 4. **Volume Anomaly Detection**
```python
# Implementation: senate_insight/analyzers/insider_trading_detector.py
def _detect_volume_anomaly(self, transaction_date, stock_prices):
    """Uses statistical analysis (z-scores) to identify unusual volume"""
```
- Detects unusual trading volume around transaction dates
- Compares transaction day volume to historical baseline (30-day average)
- Uses statistical analysis to identify outliers (z-score > 2.0)
- May indicate potential information leaks

### Confidence Scoring Formula

Each alert receives a weighted confidence score (0-1 scale):

```python
# Weighting formula (configurable in InsiderTradingDetector)
confidence = (
    timing_score * 0.30 +           # 30% weight
    committee_score * 0.25 +         # 25% weight
    price_movement_score * 0.35 +    # 35% weight
    volume_anomaly_score * 0.10      # 10% weight
)
```

**Alert Thresholds:**
- **🚨 High Confidence (≥0.70)**: Strong indicators requiring investigation
- **⚠️ Medium Confidence (0.50-0.69)**: Suspicious patterns worth reviewing
- **ℹ️ Low Confidence (0.30-0.49)**: Weak indicators, potentially coincidental
- **Below 0.30**: Filtered out by default (configurable)

## 🔧 Configuration

The system is configurable via environment variables or direct API configuration.

### Environment Variables (`.env` file)

```bash
# API Keys (optional - examples work without these)
CONGRESS_API_KEY=your_congress_api_key_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key_here

# Analysis Parameters
TIMING_WINDOW_DAYS=30              # Days to check before/after trades
SIGNIFICANT_PRICE_CHANGE=0.05      # 5% price movement threshold
MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.3       # Minimum alert confidence

# Data Collection
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=5          # API rate limiting
REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS=1.0         # Delay between requests
```

### Programmatic Configuration

```python
from senate_insight.analyzers.insider_trading_detector import InsiderTradingDetector

# Initialize with custom parameters
detector = InsiderTradingDetector()
detector.timing_window_days = 45                    # Extend time window
detector.significant_price_change = 0.03            # Lower threshold (3%)
detector.min_confidence_threshold = 0.2             # Include more alerts
```

## 📚 Code Examples

    member_id="S001",
    name="Senator Example",
    chamber="Senate",
    state="CA",
    party="Democratic",
    committees=["Technology Committee"]
)
